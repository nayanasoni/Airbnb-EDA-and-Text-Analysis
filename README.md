# Airbnb-EDA-and-Text-Analysis
An end-to-end project exploring Airbnb listings in New York, featuring exploratory data analysis (EDA) and sentiment-driven text analysis of guest reviews and property descriptions.
In the first part, we examine factors like pricing, neighborhoods, and property types to uncover trends in the short-term rental market. The second part dives into text-based features such as guest reviews and property descriptions, using text analysis techniques to extract sentiment and insights.

# Data Source
The dataset was obtained from Airbnbâ€™s public listings for New York City
